# Introduction

Scotch is going to help you learn an awesome library in a really fun way. What could be more fun than making a music app?

Yeah I get it! You have been hearing [`React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) thrown around these days but you have had no reason to learn it yet or rather you have tried but it just didn't work. Together we will build a fairly complex but easy to understand music app with React, [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) which is going to cover everything you need to know about React and its best practices.

It is difficult to convince people to learn a new library or framework and I understand that. I am coming from an Angular background and I consider myself a professional for that matter. For that reason I never considered learning React until I came across [this video](https://youtu.be/XxVg_s8xAms).
